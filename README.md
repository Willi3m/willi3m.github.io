Description: For my countdown timer I was inspired by the design of the vintage CASIO watch. And so I tried to design my timer to resemble the watch interface as can be seen in the sketch. But I was not able to implement a clock animation on the left side and so instead I used a png of a clock face. This should not affect the functionality of the timer at all.
